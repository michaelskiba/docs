# Mike is Dark

Mike, this entire document is generated from one markdown file. It's the coolest thing I've ever seen. It's also a Ruby project, so it's open source - it can be customized many different ways. 

# Dome How-To's

```ruby
if there is a video, image or other
```


> Make sure you remind me of how awesome I am later.

Kittn uses API keys to allow access to the API. You can register a new Kittn API key at our [developer portal](http://example.com/developers).

Kittn expects for the API key to be included in all API requests to the server in a header that looks like the following:

`Authorization: meowmeowmeow`

<aside class="notice">
You must replace <code>meowmeowmeow</code> with your personal API key.
